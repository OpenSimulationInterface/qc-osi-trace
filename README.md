## Installation and usage

qc-osi-trace can be installed using pip or from source.

### Installation using pip

qc-osi-trace can be installed using pip, so that it can be used as a library or as an application.

```bash
pip install qc-osi-trace@git+https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/qc-osi-trace@main
```

**Note**: To install from different sources, you can replace `@main` with
your desired target. For example, `develop` branch as `@develop`.

#### To use as a library

After installation, the usage is similar to the one expressed in the
[`main.py`](./qc_ositrace/main.py) script:

```Python3
from qc_ositrace.checks.deserialization import deserialization_checker
```

#### To use as an application

```
qc_ositrace --help

usage: QC OSI Trace Checker [-h] (-d | -c CONFIG_PATH)

This is a collection of scripts for checking validity of OSI Trace (.osi)
files.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --default_config
  -c CONFIG_PATH, --config_path CONFIG_PATH
```

### Installation from source

The project can be installed from source using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```bash
poetry install
```

After installing from source, the usage is the same as shown above.

It is also possible to execute the qc_ositrace application using Poetry.

```bash
poetry run qc_ositrace --help

usage: QC OSI Trace Checker [-h] (-d | -c CONFIG_PATH)

This is a collection of scripts for checking validity of OSI Trace (.osi)
files.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --default_config
  -c CONFIG_PATH, --config_path CONFIG_PATH
```

## Tests

To run the tests, you need to install the extra test dependency.

```bash
poetry install --with dev
```

### Execute tests

```bash
poetry run pytest -vv
```

They should output something similar to:

```bash
